  Unfortunately, as Zoroastrians living in Iran, we face both legal and social restrictions that make it nearly impossible to openly develop or present scientific innovations. Religious discrimination, combined with international sanctions, has created a hostile environment for independent research and technological advancement.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6;">
  Despite these challenges, the BioWarn-X Smart Dental Implant project has already shown promising results and has been positively received by experts in the medical and engineering communities. We believe this innovation can save lives and change the future of preventive medicine — but it needs global support to move forward.

    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>
      We are independent engineers and researchers from Iran, belonging to the peaceful and ancient Zoroastrian minority.
      In a country where religious discrimination, censorship, and political limitations affect innovation, we have been forced to remain anonymous.
      Working without institutional funding, we are building a technology that may save lives—starting with immunocompromised patients.

    <h2>About BioWarn-X</h2>
    <p>
      BioWarn-X is a revolutionary passive smart dental implant that detects early infection without radiation or batteries.
      It uses advanced biocompatible materials and NFC sensing to provide real-time safety feedback for patients undergoing chemotherapy,
      organ transplant recipients, and those with weakened immune systems.

    <h2>Why We Ask for Support</h2>
    <p>
      Due to international sanctions, our nationality, and our religion, we are completely excluded from the global funding ecosystem.
      We cannot use PayPal, banking systems, or platforms like Patreon or GoFundMe.
      We are choosing to build BioWarn-X with courage and truth—but we can’t do it alone.
